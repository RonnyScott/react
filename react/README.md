# React.js Fundamentals Assignment

## Objective

This assignment focuses on applying React.js concepts:
- Creating functional components
- Managing state with hooks
- Handling events
- Styling using Tailwind CSS

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (via NVM recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-assignment
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Configure Tailwind CSS:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure
```

```

## Functional Components
- **Header**: Displays a title.
- **Profile**: Accepts user details (name, email) as props and displays them.
- **Counter**: Uses state to track and display a count with increment functionality.

## State Management
- **useState Hook**: 
  - Used to manage and update component states.
  - Event handlers interact with the state (e.g., increment counter, update profile info).

## Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Utility classes are used for styling components.
- Ensures a responsive and visually appealing UI.

## Testing
- Run the project and verify all components function as expected.
- Ensure there are no console errors or warnings.

## Documentation
- API and component usage instructions are provided.
- README contains setup and usage details.

## Submission
- Push your code to your GitHub repository.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Proper implementation of React components and hooks.
- Effective use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Well-structured project organization.
- Clear and concise documentation.
- Successful testing of all components.
